# rutwe
Head First FP Compiler.

Inspired by some African (Burundi) jokes, `Rutwe` is a `Big Head`. It is meant to be an exploratory endeavor into
the arcanes of a fully-featured Functional Programming language inspired by Haskell. Contrary to what's in its name,
you don't need a PhD to write your own compiler.

I'll keep enriching this page with more information as I'm moving alone.

## credits

A few projects (and their people) have inspired this work, so these ideas aren't mine and I would like to give credits
back to the original posters:

- GhC Haskell
- Nix language
- Hobbes
- Haskell-in-Haskell
- ML
- Tapl
- PFPL

and more.
